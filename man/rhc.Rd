\title{Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 5735 rows and 63 variables.

\usage{
data(rhc)
}
\description{
Data from the SUPPORT study (Connors et al., 1996) examining the effectiveness of
Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) in the management of critically ill patients.
This dataset is a classic example of high-dimensional confounding in medical observational studies.
}
\details{
The original study found that RHC was associated with higher mortality, contradicting
potential benefits. Careful adjustment for the rich set of covariates (indicating sickness severity)
is required. This dataset serves as a testbed for sensitivity analysis and policy bounds.

Key variables include \code{swang1} (treatment), \code{dth30} (30-day mortality),
\code{t3d30} (survival time up to 30 days), and \code{aps1} (APACHE III score).
