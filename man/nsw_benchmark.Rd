A data frame with 2915 rows and 11 variables:

\item{age}{Age in years}
\item{education}{Years of schooling}
\item{black}{Indicator for Black race}
\item{hispanic}{Indicator for Hispanic race}
\item{married}{Indicator for marital status}
\item{nodegree}{Indicator for no high school degree}
\item{re74}{Real earnings in 1974 (pre-treatment)}
\item{re75}{Real earnings in 1975 (pre-treatment)}
\item{re78}{Real earnings in 1978 (outcome)}
\item{sample_id}{Source of the observation: "nsw_treated", "nsw_control",
"cps_control", or "psid_control".}

\description{
The classical causal inference benchmark dataset constructed by Dehejia and Wahba (1999)
from the original Lalonde (1986) study. This version combines the experimental
NSW groups with the observational CPS and PSID comparison groups, enabling precise
calculation of the "deficiency" between observational and experimental inference.
}
\details{
This dataset allows you to verify causal methods by using the experimental subset
("nsw_treated" vs "nsw_control") as the ground truth, and comparing the results
obtained by adjusting the observational subsets ("nsw_treated" vs "cps_control").
